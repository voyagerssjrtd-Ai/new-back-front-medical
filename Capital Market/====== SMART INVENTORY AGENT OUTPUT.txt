**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
- SKU101 projected baseline sales for 2026 are 24 units per month on average, with adjustments for rural affordability growth (+5%) and urban GST disruptions (-2%).
- Actionable Recommendations:
  1. Target rural affordability and pack size optimizations to capitalize on demand lift (source_id: 1).
  2. Redirect marketing efforts to urban areas post-GST stabilization for better performance (source_id: 1).        
  3. Use past seasonality trends (Q1/Q3 peaks) to optimize production and inventory (source_id: 1).
