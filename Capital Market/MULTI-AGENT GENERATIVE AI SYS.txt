🎯 1. MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE AI SYSTEM

The system must use multiple agents (LLM-powered) working together.

Minimum required agents:

✔ Agent 1 — Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Agent

Reads transaction logs (JSON, XML).

Validates fields (LEI, ISIN, dates).

Detects missing values.

Outputs cleaned dataset + anomaly log.

✔ Agent 2 — Regulatory Interpreter Agent (RAG-based)

Reads regulatory texts (MiFID II, SEC reporting rules, etc.).

Uses vector embeddings + Chroma DB.

Answers:
❗ Which rules apply to each trade?
❗ What reporting items are required?

Extracts obligations and constraints.

✔ Agent 3 — Compliance Analyzer Agent

Compares transactions vs. regulatory rules.

Identifies compliance issues:

Missing LEI

Invalid ISIN

T+1 reporting violations

Wrong settlement dates

Out-of-range prices/quantities

✔ Agent 4 — Report Generator Agent

Produces:

XBRL format report

PDF compliance report

Summary explanation

Uses GPT-4o to format narrative sections.

✔ Agent 5 — Orchestrator Agent (LangGraph)

Controls workflow from Agent1 → Agent4.

Tracks errors.

Returns a final compliance status.
